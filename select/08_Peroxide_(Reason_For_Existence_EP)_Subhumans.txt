Peroxide girl with a false ID
Lost and lonely she can't see
Peroxide hair and burnt out eyes
Blinded by so many lies

(Chorus:)
Peroxide! Peroxide!
Because nobody cares?
What do you do?
You dye your hair

Her hair was just a boring mess
She had never known success
Saw the punks they didn't care
Walked around with peroxide hair

(Chorus)

Now she s out of trouble cos her hair is white
And the punks all think she's all right
But she is blind her face is red
Peroxide soaked into her head

(Chorus)
