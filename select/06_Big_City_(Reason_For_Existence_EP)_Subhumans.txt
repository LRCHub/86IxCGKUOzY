Here we are in the big, big city
Plenty of ways to spend your money
Getting ripped off is a way of life
Stick your money on a skin flint knife

No, no, no, no it's too shitty
I don't want to live in the big, big city

Tourist attractions look at that!
Buy me a plastic policeman's hat
But there's a riot uptown they're fighting back
And the boys in blue are wearing black

Flying squad what a farce
If pigs could fly they wouldn't need cars
Got control over us all
New Scotland Yard, the new Berlin Wall

Give me a break don't tell me
That life is great in the big city
It's all based on money and greed
Everything you'll never need
