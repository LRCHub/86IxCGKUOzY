What's your reason for existence?
Do you believe in anything?
Or does your lifestyle contradict
The words you write the songs you sing?

Are you happy in your work
As you protest about the unemployed?
You don't wanna work but you need the money
The reality you can't avoid

But do you wanna work
Do you wanna work
Do you really wanna work for the money?
Do you wanna work
Do you wanna work
Do you really wanna work for the system?

Are you happy as you vote
To keep the parasites alive?
You don't want to vote but you think you should
They said it was right and you never asked why

But do you wanna vote
Do you wanna vote
Do you really wanna vote for your conscience?
Do you want to vote
Do you wanna vote
Do you really wanna vote for the system?

Are you happy signing up
In the army just to get some pay?
Fighting a war without cause
Can you manage to ignore your self-decay?

But do you wanna fight
Do you wanna fight
Do you really wanna die for your country?
Do you wanna fight
Do you wanna fight
Do you really wanna die for the system?
NO!

You're their reason for existence
They use you to finance their state
The words you shout with such conviction
Is it the only way to express your hate?
