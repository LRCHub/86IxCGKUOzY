Smile - It s impossible
I-I feel disposable
You laugh (ha, ha, ha) - and it fucks me up
Fag? - has he woken you up?
Words - lots of words
Mindless - I ain't listening
Life - is it such a drag
You - don t you wanna fag?
What s wrong? Do you feel OK?
Drink? or shall we go away?
Speak! Don t just sit there!
Freak! You re going nowhere!
C'mon! Don t you want a fag?
You! Don t you want a fag?
"NO... I got cancer"
